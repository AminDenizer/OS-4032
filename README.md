### ‚úÖ Overview of System Signals in Linux

Linux uses signals as a mechanism for inter-process communication or for kernel-to-process interaction. Here‚Äôs a complete list of the 64 standard signals, each with a short explanation:

### üß™ Testing 10 Important Signals on `xclock`

To observe the behavior of various signals, the `xclock` GUI app was used. The following table documents the result of sending 10 signals:

| No. | Signal  | Code | Command Used     | Observed Effect                        |
| --- | ------- | ---- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1   | SIGSTOP | 19   | `kill -19 <PID>` | `xclock` froze (stopped execution)     |
| 2   | SIGCONT | 18   | `kill -18 <PID>` | `xclock` resumed                       |
| 3   | SIGTERM | 15   | `kill -15 <PID>` | Closed gracefully                      |
| 4   | SIGINT  | 2    | `kill -2 <PID>`  | Closed, similar to graceful exit       |
| 5   | SIGTSTP | 20   | `kill -20 <PID>` | No effect (in GUI apps, often ignored) |
| 6   | SIGKILL | 9    | `kill -9 <PID>`  | Killed instantly                       |
| 7   | SIGHUP  | 1    | `kill -1 <PID>`  | Closed (simulates terminal hang-up)    |
| 8   | SIGUSR1 | 10   | `kill -10 <PID>` | No visible effect                      |
| 9   | SIGUSR2 | 12   | `kill -12 <PID>` | No visible effect                      |
| 10  | SIGALRM | 14   | `kill -14 <PID>` | No visible effect                      |

### üß≠ Step-by-Step Instructions for Running the Experiment

1. **Start the `xclock` app**:

   ```bash
   xclock &
   ```

2. **Get the process ID (PID)**:

   ```bash
   pidof xclock
   ```

3. **Send signal to the process**:

   ```bash
   kill -<signal_number> <PID>
   # or
   kill -SIGNAME <PID>
   ```

   **Example**:

   ```bash
   kill -SIGTERM 1234
   ```

### üìå Notes

* `SIGKILL` and `SIGSTOP` cannot be caught, blocked, or ignored.
* Signals like `SIGUSR1`, `SIGUSR2`, and `SIGALRM` are application-defined ‚Äî visible behavior only occurs if the app handles them.
* Always verify the target PID before sending signals to avoid terminating critical processes.
